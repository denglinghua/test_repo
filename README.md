# Project Overview

This project is implemented using two different tech stacks and consists of three main components:

1. **WinForm (Standalone Desktop App with No Backend)**
2. **Web (ReactJS SPA - Single Page Application)**
3. **Server (Node.js Backend)**

## Components

### 1. WinForm (Standalone Desktop App with No Backend)

- A traditional desktop application that runs locally on Windows.
- Built with the .NET Framework Windows Forms, targeting **.NET Framework 4.7**.

### 2. Web (ReactJS SPA - Single Page Application)

- Built with **ReactJS**.
- Styled with **Material UI**.
- **API Communication**: Relies on the Node.js back-end for API calls.

### 3. Server (Node.js Backend)

- Built using the **Express** framework.
- **SQLite**: Used solely for storing data. It is not required for the functionality, as results can be exported without needing a database.

## How to Run

- Run the web: `npm start`
